				<h3>Importance of detecting Outliers/unusuall values</h3>
				<p> Outliers can significantly impact the results of statistical analyses, leading to inaccurate
					conclusions.</br>
					Outliers can skew the distribution of data, affecting the mean and standard deviation
					calculations.</br>
					This can lead to misleading interpretations of the data. By knowing the Data Distribution,</br>
					we can adjust our expectations related to ML-Models and take appropriate measures to handle the
					problem.

				<h3> Varity in the datast </h3>
				<p>variety in a dataset is essential for conducting thorough analyses,
					making informed decisions, improving predictive modeling accuracy, ensuring data quality.</br>
					In the case of a housing dataset where 75% of the houses have 2 or 3 bedrooms, the resulting
					predictive model may perform well in predicting prices for houses with 2 or 3 bedrooms due to the
					abundance of data in that category.

					However, if the dataset lacks variety and does not include sufficient representation of other types
					of houses (e.g., houses with 1 bedroom, 4+ bedrooms), the model may not
					generalize well to predict prices for these less represented categories.</br>
					This lack of varietycan
					lead to biases and inaccuracies in the predictions for those underrepresented categories.
					</br>
				</p>
				<h3> Power graphical presentation of data </h3>
				<p>
					In the case of a housing dataset, using histograms and box plots can help us quickly identify
					outliers in the data. Histograms provide a visual representation of the distribution of a numerical
					variable, allowing us to see any unusual patterns or extreme values. Box plots, on the other hand,
					show the spread and central tendency of the data, making it easy to spot outliers based on their
					position outside the whiskers.</br>
					By utilizing Tableau, we can explore relationships between different attributes such as the
					number of bathrooms, bedrooms, and selling price.
					Tableau allows us to create visualizations that showcase these
					relationships in a clear and intuitive way.

					The data presented in Tableau suggests that investing in a house featuring 2 bathrooms and 2 to 4
					bedrooms,
					whether furnished or unfurnished, could be a favorable choice. </p>
